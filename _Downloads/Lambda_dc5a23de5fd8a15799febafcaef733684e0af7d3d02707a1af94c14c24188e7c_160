Inline code is formatted by wrapping\nany word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be\ndisplayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:\n\n.my-link {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n\nIf you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using \nPrism.js [http://prismjs.com/].\n\nFull bleed images\nOne neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different\ntypes of images is to add a #hash  value to the end of the source URL, and then\ntarget images containing the hash with special styling. For example:\n\n\n\nwhich is styled with...\n\nimg[src$=\"#full\"] {\n    max-width: 100vw;\n}\n\n\nThis creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their\nusual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these\ntypes of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you\nwant to have a variety of image sizes and styles.\n\nReference lists\nThe quick brown fox [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox], jumped over the lazy \ndog [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog].\n\nAnother way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want\nto use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style.\nAll of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full\nseparation between content and its source or reference.\n\nCreating footnotes\nThe quick brown fox[1]  jumped over the lazy dog[2].\n\nFootnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate.\nGhost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.\n\nFull HTML\nPerhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown.\nYou can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML\nusually does.
