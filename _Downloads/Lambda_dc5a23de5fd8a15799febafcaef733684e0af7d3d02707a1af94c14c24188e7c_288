The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can\nquickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.\n\nAt the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options\nto help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a\n ?  icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.\n\nFor now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make\nsure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.\n\nFormatting text\nThe most common shortcuts are of course, bold  text, italic  text, and \nhyperlinks [https://example.com]. These generally make up the bulk of any\ndocument. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard\nshortcuts.\n\n * CMD/Ctrl + B  for Bold\n * CMD/Ctrl + I  for Italic\n * CMD/Ctrl + K  for a Link\n * CMD/Ctrl + H  for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)\n\nWith just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way\nto creating a beautifully formatted story.\n\nInserting images\nImages in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an\nexclamation mark, like this:\n\n![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)\n\n\n\nMost Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can\nclick on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can\njust click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both\nwill upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.\n\nImportant Note:  Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's\nalways a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files before \nuploading them to Ghost.\n\nMaking lists\nLists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an\nabsolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation.\nFor numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use *  or\n -  or +. Like this:\n\n 1. Crack the eggs over a bowl\n 2. Whisk them together\n 3. Make an omelette\n\nor\n\n * Remember to buy milk\n * Feed the cat\n * Come up with idea for next story\n\nAdding quotes\nWhen you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece,\nyou can use >  at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You\nmight've seen this formatting before in email clients.\n\nA well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand\nthe most important points being made\n\nAll themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look\nbetter kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of\ntext and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes\nsparingly.\n\nDividing things up\nIf you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a\ncouple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just\nwhat you need.
