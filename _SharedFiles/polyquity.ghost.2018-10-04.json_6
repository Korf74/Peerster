nt to put your site behind closed doors\n\nIf you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because\nit's not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a simple shared\npass-phrase.\n\nYou can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost's General Settings\n\n\n\nGhost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share\nwith anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it. While this\nsetting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off\nto help keep the site off the radar.\n\nDo remember though, this is not  secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on\nthis feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared\npass-phrase for very basic privacy.","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/locked.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2018-03-27T09:06:31.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-03-27T09:16:08.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-03-27T09:06:32.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5aba099730a4450868af95bd","uuid":"bf117a2e-a129-4a51-a4ae-778fb3f1edd1","title":"Managing Ghost users","slug":"managing-users","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team\\n\\n\\n### Authors\\n\\nThe base user level in Ghost is an author.
